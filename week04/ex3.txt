The program has a sleep counter of five seconds, that is after every five seconds a fork is called (which creates a child process). In the first iteration, only the main process is in the existence, but after the further iterations, the new child process creates their own child process, leading to the creation of 2^(n) processes, which in this case is 8 process.

Simillar to the 3 fork calls, the five fork calls will also go and create many child process, around 2^(5) = 32 processes.
