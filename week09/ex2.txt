5 page frames:

Sequence with high hit/miss ratio:
1 1 1 1 1  2 2 2 2 2
 Hits: 8, Misses: 2
 Hits/Misses = 4.00000

The reason of high hits is that the pages which are getting referenced
were referenced in the recent times which result increases their likelihood
to be present in the page table.

Sequence with low hit/miss ratio:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 5 4 3 2 1 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
 Hits: 0, Misses: 26
    Hits/Misses = 0.000000

The reason of the low hit/miss ratio is that the pages which were not accessed recently
will cause a page fault when accesed at distant time interval because of their increased
chance of swapping from the page table. (According to the ageing algorithm)

This results from the principle of time locality.
