The method which can be used to specify the permissions granted of a file in
octal system, where the first, second and third is of user, group and others
respectively.

For example, a permission of 712 for a file X represents:
	u	g	o
	7	1	2

Now, in binary system they are:
	rwx	rwx	rwx
	111	001	010
, where r - stands for read permissions, w - for write permissions, and
 x - for execute permissions.

so, 	rwx
  - 7 - 111	-> can read, write and execute the file
  - 1 - 001	-> can only execute, no read/write
  - 2 - 010	-> can only write

Now, the questions from the lab:

1. what does 660 mean for ex3.txt?
 - u - 6 - 110	-> user can read, and write but not execute
 - g - 6 - 110	-> group can read, and write but not execute
 - o - 0 - 000	-> others cannot read, write and execute

2. what does 775 mean for ex3.txt?
 - u - 7 - 111	-> user can read, and write and execute
 - g - 7 - 111	-> group can read, and write and execute
 - o - 5 - 101	-> others can read, and execute, but not write.
 
3. what does 777 mean for ex3.txt?
 - u - 7 - 111	-> user can read, and write and execute
 - g - 7 - 111	-> group can read, and write and execute
 - o - 7 - 111	-> others can read, write and execute.
